MsPacMan
========
University of Essex semi-annual AI challenge
pacman-vs-ghosts.net

Goal
====
Beat the starter package

Strategy
========
This is the first competition that includes ghost entries, so I'm gonna put most of my efforts there, I think.  I'm probably just going to use an obfuscated diffusion algorithm for the ghosts, ms. pacman will most likely be the starter plus a bunch of edge case hacks.  That should at least accomplish the goal.

Entry Name
==========
magnum
